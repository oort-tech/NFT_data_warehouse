## Summary
in this project, we develop a subgraph where users can easily query NFT data or sales history from OpenSea in a standardized format, without needing to understand the underlying smart contract code or manage complex indexing and caching themselves. This platform can make it easier for developers to build NFT-related applications on top of OpenSea and can help to foster innovation and growth in the NFT ecosystem.
